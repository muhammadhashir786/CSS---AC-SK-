Syntax of CSS:

1. Selector:

we use selector to write css
selector selects the html elements on which this style will be applied.

2. Open Curly braces {:

after selector, type open curly braces.

3. Property & value:

then css property and value in it.

4. Close Curly braces }:

then close the culy braces.

Representation:

selector {
    property: value;
}

Code:

h1 {
    color: red;
}

Note:   if we don't write semi-colon at the end of value, when we write single property value pair then code will work but this is not good.
        this is the best praticse to write semi-colon at the end.
