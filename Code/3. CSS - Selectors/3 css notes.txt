Part 2: CSS Selectors

if we want to add style to any HTML element, 
then first we need to select that HTML element in CSS file,
then define any CSS property and value for that HTML element.

Types of Selectors:

there are many Selectors in CSS:

1. Universal Selector
2. Element Selector
3. id and class Selector

these 3 selectors are the most used selectors in css

1. Universal Selector:

The asterisk "*" is called universal selector and it is the basic selector in css.

Syntax:

* {}

universal selector selects all the HTML elements under the body and itself body tag.
universal selector sets the style for the whole document.
if we give any style to the universal selector then it will apply to all the elements that are present in the body of HTML document.

Representation:

* {
    property: value;
}

if we set any color for the text inside the universal selector,
then the text color sets for the whole HTML documents or all the elements that are present in the body of HTML document.
if you want to set the font style for the whole HTML document, then define font style property in the universal selector.

2. Element Selector:

select the HTML elements in css by calling the name of HTML element is called Element Selector.
if we type h1 or p, it selects all the h1 or p elements in the HTML document.

Example:

h1 {
    color: blue;
}

p {
    color: red;
}

if we define some styles in universal selector, 
then we also define some styles for specific elements like h1 or p tag using element selector or any other selectors, 
then the priority comes to element selector or some other, not priority is universal selector.
css line by line style apply krta hai 
css m jo cheez bad m define ki jaati hai uski ziada priority hoti hai

at first, if we set any property to any any element or all the elements, 
and later we changed or define another value for that property in another line in css file, 
so what I changed at last, that will be the highest priority in CSS and that will apply to the elements jis k lye mene define kia hai

if there is more than 1 "p" tag in HTML document, then the style that we defined for "p" element, it will apply for all the "p" elements in the HTML document or the webpage.

3. id selector:

we can give or define an specific "id" to every HTML elements.
and we can understand/take "id" as "another name" of every HTML elements.
but the id should always be unique for all the HTML elements.
id always define in the start tag of HTML elements.

why we give the "unique id" to HTML elements?

we give the unique id to every elements in the HTML document, so that we can target or define specific styles for only that "id element" in the CSS, from all the other elements in all our the HTML document.

we call the id selector with "#" then write the value of id to give styles to this id in CSS file.

we can give same id for multiple elements, it will work but it is wrong and this is bad practise, a professional coder does not do this, so it is not recommended.
id is not to give same id to multiple elements.
For this, we use "class" for multiple elements.

Syntax:

HTML code:

    <p id="value">some content</p>

CSS code:

select id in css:

#value {

}

Example :

if we have 3 paragraph elements in HTML document.
then we give id "para1" to first paragraph element 
give id "para2" to second paragraph element 
and same as id "para3" to third paragraph element

HTML Code:

<p id="para1">this is some content of line 1</p>
<p id="para2">this is some content of line 2</p>
<p id="para3">this is some content of line 3</p>

CSS Code:

#para1 {
    property: value;
}

#para2 {
    property: value;
}

#para3 {
    property: value;
}

Class Selector:

class is same as id but opposite to id.
the value of class will be same for many elements 
we can give same class to multiple elements.
if we want to target a specific group of elements in the HTML document, we can give the same class to that elements
if we want to give same style to multiple elements, then we can give same class to all that elements
we can target many different HTML elements by giving same class and define styles for all that elements at once by targetting 1 class and define some property and value to that class.
class is not unique for all the HTML elements.

we can define same style for many elements by giving same class to that elements,
then call that class in css file and give property and value to it, and define the style for all that elements at once.
we call the class selector in css file by dot "." and then type the value of class and give styles to this class.

code available in html and css file!

the most used selectors in css are id and class selector.
