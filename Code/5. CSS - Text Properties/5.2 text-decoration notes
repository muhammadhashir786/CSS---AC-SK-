Chapter 5: CSS Text Properties

2. text-decoration-line property:

the text-decoration-line property defines the different types of lines decoraion in text.

4 Values:

none - which is bydefault
underline - display bottom of text 
overline - display top of text
line-through - cut the text from center

text-decoration-line property does not used so much

but if we see the anchor tag, then bydefault anchor tag has a "text-decoraion-line" property set to "underline". 
all the links will display in the webpage with "underlined" bydefault.

and if we don't want this underline in anchor tag 
then select the anchor tag in css file and set "text-decoraion-line" property to "none".
after that link will display without underline.
