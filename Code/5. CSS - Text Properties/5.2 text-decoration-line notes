More About Text Decoration Line Property:

text-decoration-line property does not used so much in website

but if we see the anchor tag, then bydefault anchor tag has a "text-decoraion-line" property set to "underline". 
most of the links display in the webpage with "underlined" bydefault.

and if we don't want this underline show below the links,
then select the anchor tag in css file and set "text-decoraion-line" property to "none".
after that link will display without underline.
