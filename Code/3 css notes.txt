Part 3: CSS Selectors

if we want to add style to any HTML element, 
then first we need to select that HTML element in CSS file,
then define CSS property and value for that HTML element.

Types of Selectors:

there are many types of Selectors in CSS:

1. Universal Selector:

The asterisk "*" is called universal selector and it is the basic selector.

Syntax:

* {}

universal selector selects all the HTML elements under the body and itself body tag.
universal selector sets the style for the whole document.
if we give any style to the universal selector then it will apply all the elements that are present in the body of HTML document.

Representation:

* {
    property: value;
}

if we set any color for the text inside the universal selector,
then the color sets for the whole HTML documents or all the elements that are present in the body of HTML document.
